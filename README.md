## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Apps I Like : Instagram, Crunchyroll, Tiktok

Instagram : I like because you get to interact with people, and notification system
Crunchyroll : It saves what you like, and reccomends 
TikTok : Community interaction and alogirthm that shows you more things you might like

App Idea : A daily planning app you can share with others. You can post your daily taks and schedules to make collobaration
          Easier with others. Or to just flex your super cool schedule. People can like and comment as well.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
